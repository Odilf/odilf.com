title: Series that don't have 3s

My 2019 attempt to make a series that has $0$ every third element and $n$ otherwise.

# Backstory

One of the last math topics we did in 9th grade (3ยบ de la ESO) was series. My math teacher at the time (Marta) put up the challenge of coming up with a series that is just like $a_n = n$, except every third number it has to be $0$. I, of course, took the challenge. However, I couldn't have expected how interesting this problem would end up being. Here I've compiled all the solutions I came up with back in 2019[^1].
