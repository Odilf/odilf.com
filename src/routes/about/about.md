I'm Odysseas Machairas, also know as Ody, also known as Οδυσσέας Μαχαίρας. Here is some stuff about me.

<span class='faint'> This section is incomplete and hap-hazardly put together in general because it's awkard to write a sort-of resume for like no reason? </span>

# Today

Currently I'm in my first year of Computer Science at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), in the Netherlands. 

# Hobbies and interests

I really like math and music (and cuddles, but that doesn't fit here). Most of my time nowadays is spent coding things (see [projects](/projects)) and making music. 

# Studies

I did the spanish Bachillerato and the IB, finishing with a 42/45. In the IB specifically I did Spanish A, English B and Math HL and History, Business Management and Biology SL. I did physics and chemestry in the national system. 

# All around

I was born in Greece but I've lived all over the place. I spent 2 years in Greece, 3 in Belgium, but most of my life I've lived in Spain. I moved to the Netherlands when I turned 18 to study Computer Science at TUDelft.
