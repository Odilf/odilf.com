	<h1> About me </h1>

	<body>
		<h3> Where I'm from </h3>
		<p> 
			I was born in Greece and I lived in Belgium before moving to Spain when I was five years old, where I have lived ever since. I speak fluently Greek and Spanish, but the language I'm most comfortable in is English, since I believe it is essential in our current interconected world. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I can also hold conversations in french, but I may struggle a bit with that one ðŸ˜…
		</p>
		
		<h3> Studies </h3>
		<p>
			I'm currently doing the <a href='https://www.ibo.org/' target='_blank'> International Baccalaureate </a> in Madrid. 
			In the future, I want to study computer science and mathematics.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I love learning and I have used the internet to expand my knowledge in most academic areas. I'm especially fond of math, because of YouTube channels like <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw' target='_blank'> 3blue1brown</a>.
		</p>

		<h3> Hobbies </h3>
		<h4> Music </h4>
		<p>
			Probably my biggest passion is making music. Funnily enough, when I was younger I took guitar lessons, which made me hate the guitar, and music in general. However, I started playing piano on my own and, thorugh whatever information I could find online, I learned to play. I developed proficiency and started playing bass, drums and saxophone. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowadays, one of my favourite things to do is play some music. Sometimes with my friends, sometimes recording songs by myself. I really love the process of music making and I would now consider it a crucial part of myself.

		<h4> Speedcubing (Rubik's cubes) </h4>
		<p>
			I have been solving cubes since I was 8.
